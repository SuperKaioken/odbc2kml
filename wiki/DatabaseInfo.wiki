#summary Database problem fix and query info.

= Introduction =

There is a problem with the database that I created for our data and put on the SVN. The ID fields in the database do not auto-increment and the location field in IconLibrary (set to 50) is to small.  Also this describes how to run a query against your local database using visual studio.


= Details =

To fix the first error you may go to each ID that you wish changed to auto-increment and do the following:
1. Open Visual studio, go to tools and click Connect to Database
           ServerName=(yourComputer'sName)\SQLEXPRESS            database is odbc2kml
2. click on odbc2kml.dbo, click Tables
3. right click on the table you desire to change and click "Open table definition"
4. click on primary key, and scroll down on the "column properties" window
5. click the plus next to "Identity specification" and change "(is identity)" to yes
      (Identity increment and Identity seed should set themselves to 1, if not, you should)
      (if you have errors in visual studio, download Microsoft SQL server management studio
          express and use it)
6. click save

To fix the small size of location do steps 1-3 above
4. click on location, change varchar(50) to (150)
5. click save

To run queries in visual studio do steps 1-2 above
3. right click on the table you desire to change and click new query
