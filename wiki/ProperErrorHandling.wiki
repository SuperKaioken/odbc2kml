This wiki has information on how the ODBC2KML project uniformly handles errors.


= Details =

First add the ODBC2KMLException.cs file to your project.

If you are working on a support class (one not tied to an .aspx page) do the following:
  * When you encounter an error, type: 
{{{
throw new ODBC2KMLException("Error Text Here");
}}}

If you are working on a .aspx page, you need to catch ODBC2KMLExceptions.  Here is how you do that:
  * Put a try block around any code that could have an error
  * Have this code as your catch block: 
        {{{
catch (ODBC2KMLException ex)
{
     ErrorHandler eh = new ErrorHandler(ex.errorText, errorPanel1);
     eh.displayError();
     return;
}
}}}

You can look at Database.cs and DBTest.cs as examples.
